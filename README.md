# Web-Amazon-Clone

Web-Amazon-clone Built using HTML, CSS, and javascript, and with the addition of React and Bootstrap frameworks. It replicates the layout and design of Amazon.

This website only has an Amazon landing page. The code includes the header, Bottom Panel, Menu, Content, and Footer.

Here is a breakdown of the different sections in the code:

1. Header
- Contains the Amazon logo, delivery address, search bar, language selection, sign-in information, and cart icon.
2. BottomPanel
- Contains links to different sections such as Today's Deals, Customer Service, Registry, Gift Cards, and Sell.
3. Menu

4. Content
